We knew the food would be good, but had no idea we would leave all agreeing this is the best Asian restaurant in Prague. The best part is, this casual and unassuming atmosphere, staffed by a happy, friendly, and knowledgeable team, has every right to put on airs of pretension, but doesnt, keeping the focus on what matters - the truly exceptional and creative flavors emerging from the kitchen!

We loved the tuna sashimi, black ink squid, and soft shell crab tacos for starters. The tuna is a masterpiece.

We had pork belly, Tsos chicken, and crispy duck for mains, followed by a vigorous argument over which one was actually the best thing we had ever eaten.

We finished with the sponge cake, which defies description for both taste and creativity.

Lee, the owner, can be seen frequently stopping by tables throughout the restaurant in-between trips to the kitchen, jumping into friendly conversations with guests, mainly about how hes coming up with all of these ideas for this plate magic hes serving!

Truly exceptional stuff happening here, not to be missed in Prague. Make a reservation if you really want a table!

Thanks Lee!!

We passed by the restaurant at lunchtime, captivated by its Bali-inspired decor. When I saw pepes (a dish cooked in a banana leaf) on the menu, I knew it had to be Indonesian-inspired.

So, we decided to return for dinner. We were lucky they still accepted walk-ins, as we assumed it might be fully booked.

The moment we entered, the Balinese decor and the bartender made it clear that the owner must be Balinese or at least Indonesian!

We were warmly welcomed by a waitress, and then the owner himself greeted us.

We ordered sea bass pepes, curry lamb shank, and Indonesian fried rice. Having tried many Indonesian restaurants in the UK and Europe, I can assure you this place has the most authentic taste and serves the best Indonesian food abroad!

We had great conversations with the owner and the chefs, who are all truly Balinese.

We will definitely return every time we visit Prague!

I took off one star because at the end there was a tip option. I'm well aware that Europe does not do tipping as staff don't make less than the min wage unlike America which is why there is tipping. I feel like this is just a mini tourist scam which I find very annoying.

Let me tell about a place to see.
A place of passion and fashion,
A place to bring satisfaction.

A little Asian haven,
With a kitchen filled with maven.
Where the service,
Puts in that final spice.

Where no dish is left bland,
This would not be withstand.
Chefs careful plating,
Feels like special dating.
A romance of taste
Come in, visit this place.
This is a precious gem!

While visiting Prague, I was delighted to find QQ Asian Kitchen. A marvel. Their approach of combining modern and traditional creates a unique flavour and visual. I am not surprise to see them even mentioned on the Michelin Guide.

Must try in here is Mango salad, which is a blast of flavours, and the Sponge Cake. The sweet potato gyozas were too simple for me, and I was left confused by the raw sweet potato bits.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNqbVBLV0VBEAE;"TL;DR: Reasonably priced (~$45USD/person w/ alcohol), Michelin-starred asian restaraunt in an upscale modern setting. Excellent service with above average food.

Food: On recommendation of our server, we tried the edamame, green mango salad, sweet potato & tofu potstickers, tofu and pumpkin sambal, and the monkfish coconut curry. The beef rendang was also recommended. The edamame and green mango salad were standouts. However, we were dissapointed by both of the main dishes - the portions were of ample size, but lacked the umami flavor and depth weve had from other thai/asian inspired dishes in the past.

Vibe: Airy restaraunt with large windows and an upscale, modern feel. Really great.

Service: Fantastic - fast, friendly, efficient, and attentive. Left nothing to be desired.

Value: For the above dishes w/o alcohol our total bill came to ~$95 USD which I found to be very reasonable for the quantity/quality of food we recieved.

This is the 8th Michelin starred, restaraunt we have eaten at.

Vegetarian options: Ample vegetarian options with kind staff willing to adjust as needed.

Kid-friendliness: Several kids <10years old were there while we ate. No problems

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUREaXVIQlpnEAE;"My family and I recently dined at QQ Asien Kitchen during our visit to Prague, and unfortunately, our experience was far from pleasant.

Upon sitting down, I felt discomfort due to a screw protruding from the fabric seat of the chair directly and literally speaking into my bottom, which not only punctured a hole in my leather trousers but also scratched my skin. While the waiter was quick to apologize and replace the chair, the incident had already left a mark.

Upon returning to our hotel and assessing the damage to my trousers, I reached out to the restaurant to address the issue. Despite having to contact them twice, their response was less than satisfactory. Given that my leather trousers were only 6 months old and not brand new, they refused to take responsibility or offer compensation for the damage caused.

To add insult to injury, their solution was to provide a discount for our next meal at the restaurant. This gesture was not only inadequate but also quite tone-deaf, especially considering they are well aware that I live abroad.

Overall, our dining experience at QQ Asien Kitchen was marred by their lack of accountability, poor customer service, and blatant disregard for the well-being of their patrons. I cannot, in good conscience, recommend this restaurant to anyone. If you do decide to dine here, I strongly advise you to be cautious of the screws in the chairs to avoid a similar unfortunate incident.

Its not only a restaurant, but a food experience.
We ordered 2 starters (tuna tataki and mango salad), 3 sides (marinated cucumbers, coconut rice and regular rice) and 2 mains (Taiwanese pork belly and seabass in palm leaves).
The tuna tataki is wonderful and comes with a unique seaweed and a unique sauce. The seabass was the star of the meal and I would recommend eating it with the coconut rice. The fish has a wonderful sweet, spicy and fresh flavor combination that goes great with the coconut and cashew flavors in the rice. The pork belly was also good with strong umami flavors that fit very well with the regular sauce.
We also took 2 cocktails ( The palm gin and the Pandan old fashioned) and a Czech Digestif which were very good, the digestif is quite strong though so be advised.
Overall was a wonderful meal and the staff is very nice and attentive, I know I will be back the next time well be in Prague.

We started with one of their signature cocktails, and for the food we chose the tasting menu, which, like the drink, was absolutely fantastic! Each of the courses was something special and each dish was simply amazing. At the end, we also ordered dessert, delicious fried banana with ice cream.

The price for all dishes is completely adequate and although maybe not everyone would appreciate, or know how to appreciate, this type of dinner, we liked it and we will definitely come back here again, I have no doubt about it.

And finally, Im the type of person who relishes every meal. However, in this case it was not necessary, everything was perfectly balanced in taste! 5/5

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURWdS03Rm93RRAB;"QQ Restaurant is one of my new favorite restaurants I have been anywhere in the world! I have been to a LOT of places and the level of quality and taste of food as well as service was at the very top of them all! We tried so many different dishes, from starters to mains to desserts, and everything was incredible. Not to mention the price is VERY good considering the level of good food you're getting - Michelin Star-worthy Indonesian food that tops the very best Asian restaurants anywhere! Hats off to the chefs in the kitchen!!

We got both the coconut margarita and the butterfly pea sparkling cocktail (I don't remember the exact name of it) - both were incredibly good and drinks I would order all the time at a restaurant!!

For food, we ordered the following: salmon tempura sashimi w/ yuzu butter ponzu, soft shell crab mushu taco, oyster po' bao sandwich, 5-spice pork ribs, pork & prawn shumai, pan-fried prawns in dry coconut laksa w/ pineapple & sambal matah, braised lamb shank in coconut cardamom curry, and then the fried bananas with berry ice cream as well as the salt sponge cake with coconut ice cream for dessert! Oh yeah, and we also got a side of rice and a side of nasi kuning (yellow coconut rice). It was a LOT, but the portions were quite reasonable, and this is what I like most about restaurants like this: you can get a lot of different dishes and share with everyone! For two people, this was a lot of food (obviously), but it was just so good we kept ordering more and more. So come to QQ Restaurant hungry - you will leave full!!

We spent 20 minutes trying to figure out what were our favorites...everything was so good, it was way too hard to choose! The starters and the mains were all amazing and depending on what you're craving, you would be happy with anything. Two must-trys are the 5 spice pork ribs and the salt sponge cake for dessert, so save room for dessert! That might help narrow your decision. I also want to give a massive shoutout to all the great staff working there tonight because they were great, helped us navigate the menu well, and answered any questions we had!! 10/10 restaurant!!!!!!

EDIT: We came back again tonight and once again had an incredible meal. By far my favorite Asian restaurant I've ever been to and easily in my top 3 favorite restaurants ever!! We tried some of the same dishes (our favorites - the 5-spice pork ribs as well as the salt caramel sponge cake for dessert), but also a lot of new ones, and EVERYTHING was amazing: an espresso martini, the Thai blue flower iced tea, stir-fried baby squid, grilled chicken satay lillit lemongrass skewers, fried prawn po' bao sandwich, cassava crackers, general tso's crispy sesame chicken, crispy duck w/ mushu pancakes, and mango sticky rice pudding! The drinks were wonderful, all the appetizers were beyond good, and both entrees and dessert - incredible!! This place just doesn't miss, and we have tried almost the whole menu so we KNOW that for certain. Visit QQ Restaurant next time you're in Prague!!!

Also we ordered a pot of tea and told the waiter that the tea pot had a hair in it but don't worry about replacing it because we were leaving soon (and of course we didn't drink it). The offending tea was still on the bill. It's only a few kc but it's the customer experience.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURwMnR2MzZnRRAB;"QQ Asian Kitchen was included in the Michelin Guide in 2021, but I have the impression that either something has changed since then or we just had a bad day.
It started with the service, which, although nice, was unfortunately incompetent. Out of 3 people, only one person was able to answer our questions and clearly explain what the chefs 4-course menu was all about.
We ordered an old-fashioned cocktail and another one which I dont remember. Unfortunately, both were mediocre and in no way exceptional, which is what I would expect from a high-quality restaurant.
Disappointed by the first impression, we decided to order 1 starter and 1 main course plus grilled vegetables.
We decided on bacon and ribs.
Unfortunately, another disappointment.
The bacon was quite tasty, but unfortunately, even though we only tried it, we felt an unpleasant feeling in our stomach.
The ribs were made of poor quality meat, hard and chewy.
The grilled vegetables included cold beans and the taste was comparable to vegetables served in second-rate Asian restaurants.
We returned all the food.
This was not what I expected from the description on the website, from the opinions given by customers and from the mention in the Michelin guide.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQtN2JMR0dnEAE;"It used to be one of my favorite restaurants in the previous location. Now, after the previous visit, I took a longer break, and after todays visit, I probably wont go at all.
It is indeed one of the few Michelin-starred restaurants where
- the service does not notice that you do not have a table set, and will only bring the cutlery after the food has been brought and a written warning has been given,
- the waiter doesnt really notice you if he doesnt bring you anything from the kitchen,
- the waiter overcharges you for wine for 1100+, which you buy at Markuzzis for about 250, leaves it on the table and does not refill it even once during the evening,
- the server forgets half of what you order,
- the service does not present the food brought in, it summarizes in a few words at most that it is the salad with octopus
- the operator does not show you the receipt before paying, but directly enters the amount on the terminal and expects payment,
- and overall, they all act like generally nice people who, however, started in gastronomy this month and have no one to explain to them how to treat customers.
To summarize - still quite good food at the price level of Michelin restaurants, which let you eat in an environment at the level of a better Vietnamese bistro.";genuine;0.95;0.02;0.02;0.01;0.9527;0.14666666666666667; The review provides a detailed personal account of the dining experience, including specific incidents and observations that indicate a genuine visit.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQtalpEaWJREAE;We chose this restaurant as it had good reviews and close to hotel. What a great choice. The food and service was amazing. My wife had the sweet potato and tofu potstickers and said they were just as amazing as the butternut squash and green bean sambal for appetizer. My daughter and I had sesame chicken. Ask for the sambal sauce on the side if you want a nice kick to your food. Dessert was sponge cake with banana ice cream. Everything was 5 stars and the service was amazing and owner/chef as very friendly and fun to speak with.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQtOUlfVDJ3RRAB;"I CANNOT say enough amazing things about this restaurant. Nestled on a side street and completely walkable to, I was welcomed into a two roomed restaurant with a cozy feel and impeccable decor. We were welcomed by the staff and the chef who was out talking with customers and making sure all the dishes were up to par. We got seated right away and decided to make the most of the meal by each of us ordering a chefs tasting menu. Each dish that came out was beyond my expectation with flavor, balance, aesthetics, and presentation. I will be dreaming of those roasted five spice pork ribs for a long time! We also tried several of the cocktails on the menu and our favorites were the lychee martini and the lime leaf gin drink! So floral and fruity! The chefs tasting menu comes with a dessert so we got to try that as well! The chef came out after the meal to talk to us and make us feel part of the family and the server knowledge leading us through each dish had us plenty impressed. I can not highly recommend this place enough! Make sure to try to call ahead for reservations, this place fills up fast because of how amazing it is!
