The beer I ordered also came last after the ramen and this is also after reminder. No apologies given too.

The chashu pork was pretty good but the amount of meat was small. Overall it clearly was a professionally made ramen but below my expectations. The atmosphere was a bit weird.

The toilet wasn't the cleanest but it was also in a japanese style. I had the Christmas special ramen it was really rich in flavors, it was the first time for me eating something really umami and like nothing before. The egg was perfectly done, the noodles were home made, the duck was really good cooked. And this Christmas ramen (23‚Ç¨) was a incredible choice of ingredients. I am so sorry that this one was a limited edition because I would have come any time to it again. It was a little bit sweet. For the classics they have a standard version for 15 euros I think, and one with extra toppings for 19,5 which in my opinion was worth it because every topping was tasty.

I expect quick, clear and efficient service which is definitely what is present! But a little more attention for when to take orders, or what to recommend depending on what people might like would elevate the experience even more. Like asking what kind of ramen/flavours one is craving. (My girlfriend for example had gotten the thicker broth not knowing what that would taste or be like, which ended up being far too rich for her tastes. So some input from the servers on what each bowl is like in order to taylor to each guest would add so much!)

While the ramen here leans more toward a fusion style rather than traditional, it‚Äôs absolutely delicious in its own right. I highly recommend it to any ramen lover visiting Paris.

The restaurant‚Äôs atmosphere is truly captivating, evoking the vibrant energy of Japan‚Äôs neon-lit streets.

I tried the Tori Tori Don, which was delicious with a bold, smoky wok hei flavor with an amazing aroma of szechuan pepper (from the sansho ingredient) - the flavours of this dish really reminded me of mapo tofu but with the tender chicken cubes giving a bouncier texture.

The Kurogama Ramen, the house special, stood out for its rich black sesame broth, which was rich and delicious but in my opinion slightly overpowered the other elements of the dish. It was still a unique experience and would recommend trying it! The chashu was exceptional‚Äîtender, flavorful, and you can it's made with high-quality pork as you can see the marbling on it. They've also put a creative twist to this compared to traditional chashu and I could taste hints of other spices and honey in it.

Don‚Äôt miss out on this gem!

Cons:

- the ramen was a bit too salty for my tastes but it could've been a one off for that night!
- virtual queue system is great as you can have a stroll or drink while waiting but could be improved as it said the estimated time was 20 mins but we had to wait over an hour.","{'original': ""This is hands down one of the best bowls of ramen I‚Äôve ever had‚Äîeven after experiencing authentic ramen in Japan! While the ramen here leans more toward a fusion style rather than traditional, it‚Äôs absolutely delicious in its own right. I highly recommend it to any ramen lover visiting Paris.\n\nThe restaurant‚Äôs atmosphere is truly captivating, evoking the vibrant energy of Japan‚Äôs neon-lit streets.\n\nI tried the Tori Tori Don, which was delicious with a bold, smoky wok hei flavor with an amazing aroma of szechuan pepper (from the sansho ingredient) - the flavours of this dish really reminded me of mapo tofu but with the tender chicken cubes giving a bouncier texture.\n\nThe Kurogama Ramen, the house special, stood out for its rich black sesame broth, which was rich and delicious but in my opinion slightly overpowered the other elements of the dish. It was still a unique experience and would recommend trying it! The chashu was exceptional‚Äîtender, flavorful, and you can it's made with high-quality pork as you can see the marbling on it. They've also put a creative twist to this compared to traditional chashu and I could taste hints of other spices and honey in it.\n\nDon‚Äôt miss out on this gem!\n\nCons:\n\n- the ramen was a bit too salty for my tastes but it could've been a one off for that night!\n- virtual queue system is great as you can have a stroll or drink while waiting but could be improved as it said the estimated time was 20 mins but we had to wait over an hour.""}","{'service': 4, 'meal_type': 'Dinner', 'price_per_person': '‚Ç¨20‚Äì30', 'food': 4, 'atmosphere': 5, 'recommended_dishes': 'Black Sesame Ramen'}",,"{'date': 'a week ago', 'iso_date': '2025-02-26T16:00:34Z', 'iso_date_of_last_edit': '2025-02-26T16:00:34Z', 'snippet': 'Hello Jeffrey, \n\nThank you so much for your detailed and thoughtful review!

We arrived just after lunch, so there was no line and we were seated immediately. The moment we walked in, we felt transported to an izakaya in Tokyo.\nWe ordered the Kurogama Ramen (with spicy sauce) and Shoyu Ramen. Service was fast, and both bowls arrived piping hot. The broth was tasty and umami-filled, and the thin noodles had the perfect chewiness. However, I was a bit disappointed with the Kurogama Ramen, as the spice level was quite mild.
