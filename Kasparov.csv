ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURfenZuZm13RRAB;How can the food be great anywhere. When the service first leaves a bad taste in your mouth.  First off.   Not a single Japanese person in site. Pakistani cooks. Impersonal waiters.  Super uncomfortable place to sit.   It’s difficult to rate this place. While the food is unique.  Tasty ramen.  No question.   But the service was terrible.   The only good thing about this place was the Italian French kid at the door.  Super funny. Nice guy. But that’s it.   Cool atmosphere. But super hard to relax.    Sitting at the high tops you have people running back and forth  banging into you all the time.  The cook who was dipping his fingers into everyone’s ramen  placing the eggs inside. And nori etc.  kept touching SKITS And paper and scratching his face. Then placing the food by hand in the bowls.   Not washing his hands once.  Meanwhile. The pasta boiler. Sous chef. Who didn’t touch food at all. Washed his hands like 10 times in 10 minutes.    Insane.   Also.  Well overpriced for  what you get.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNuOC02NTdRRRAB;The food tasted okay, rather underwhelming for a nearly 3-hours wait. Even in Japan you don’t share tables with strangers, yet you are forced to sit with strangers after an arduous wait. I started queuing with 1hr 40minutes to my turn, it is still okay if not for the fact that I turned up at the stated time on the app only to wait another 40 minutes by the door. And another 30 minutes for my food. All could be redeemed with good food, but the food is downright underwhelming. Give this a miss if you are a traveller/tourist from Asia.

Then once you get a seat be prepared to wait another 30-40 min for your food in the restaurant. You really start to question your sanity and whether that was a complete waste of time.

It seems that being just about as far away from Japan as you can get has its consequences... I think that I have had pretty good Ramen in my time, so when I heard that a Michelin recommended Ramen shop was in Paris, I had to stop by. It was a busy day obviously, because I had to wait outside for nearly 2 hours for a seat for just myself! All this would be forgivable and even expected if the place respected my patronage while inside. Yet, they forget about my starters, give me the Ramen first, then ask me if I still want my starters after having to flag them down. Then, the cherry on top was that at no point was I offered water or given any. They put multiple water pitchers on the table, but conveniently none within my reach, so, unless I asked a stranger to pass their pitcher, no water was received. [And the space is so small, and there's only one bathroom, and it's hard to get to, aaaaaaah]
Service issues aside, I'm sorry to report that nothing was that great, let alone Michelin worthy. While the broth was good on initial hit, it failed to have a lasting impact for wanting more. The noodles were basic, and the Cashu Pork cuts were unreasonably big and long. The Tamagos didn't pop, and is it impossible to find anything in France that's actually spicy, even when advertised as such? All that's to say, I have had much better Ramens across my many stops through the Pacific North West, all with better Ramen and sides than this one. The dessert was the only bright light in that meal, and I hope for the People of Paris' sake that this place takes considerable measures to make it an experience worth waiting for.";Authentique ;2;a year ago;2023-05-02T19:39:17Z;0;113313201182296645938;Maria Wessel;19;50;VRAI;€40–50;Lunch;2;2;4

The preparation for the ramen was very unclean, the floor was literally swimming in broth that had to be swept to the drain, the noodles were being shaken dry by the floor instead of the sink or the noodle station, the servers had their fingers in the broth multiple times as they picked up the ramen, the broth just looked like it was mostly chicken without any traditional seaweed, or fish stock in it. Service was awfully bad as they forgot to put serve the ramen with the extra egg ordered, nor did the server manage to punch in our dessert order and made us wait 15 minutes wondering what is happening. This place has no soul and love for the ramen and 100 percent got their Michelin star from how the ambiance and decoration of the place (which I will say was well done). Avoid this place if you expect Michelin star execution and love for ramen.;the review is excessively negative, details about specific problems, and has a single star rating, which is a high suspicion factor combined with a low user suspicion score, suggesting a fake review.

The good: amazing decor. One of the most unique Japanese style atmosphere I have been to.

Now the bad: we ordered a Shouyo Ramen and Koruseasame ramen. The broth was VERY VERY salty. I was fascinated by the huge keg of chicken broth sitting in front of me while waiting for my ramen and promised myself that I will not waste a single drip after such a long wait. Unfortunately, I was barely able to finish even half of the broth because of the saltiness. For 13.5 euro “classic” ramen, one piece of pork + two pieces of bamboo shoots in a soy sauce broth doesn’t seem to justify its price. Otherwise, you can opt in for the deluxe bowl at 18.5 with an extra egg and some others.

As I said, food is alright. I ordered the sesame one. Just the broth base was a wee bit dry and not savory enough, apart from that, I was quite enjoying my ramen.

However, I took other three stars off because of the service.

First, you cannot ask customers to stand outside to check menu or use Google translate for the menu. I believe that’s not people expect to enjoy in Paris. Mostly, the waitress s attitude should have been better toward non French speaking customers.

The decor was very tacky. It tries too hard to be Japanese, without considering how it feels to sit on a tiny stool with a big lantern hitting your face every time you move to eat the ramen.

The food was below average - bland, thin noodles and expensive. I ordered their special, which was supposed to be hot, but instead the ramen tasted like diluted pesto water. It was not the vibe. The broth had absolutely no seasoning in it. Luckily, the only thing they managed to get right was the temperature of the soft boiled egg.

The atmosphere is nice, but keep in mind it’s cramped and hard to move around. We didn’t wait long to get in, but because this restaurant is popular at the moment, the wait can be very long (40 mins - 1 hr). Also, make sure to see an itemized receipt before you pay; they just shove a card reader in front of you without showing you the total amount of the bill.

When we asked one of the other waiters whether they could take the order they refused as it was not their table. At least what I expect is water or a drink order. When the waitress came back she took an order for the 1st group that had been waiting longer than us. Them she disappeared after taking the order - for a Ramen restaurant this was disappointing from beginning to end - we did not feel like to wait more and left the restaurant. While we waited the waiters were busy ushering more guests into the restaurant. This is not the way. If you cannot handle the existing guests why bring in more.

1st they make you use a terrible app that kicked us out of the ""digital queue"" after we had waited in it for 90 minutes. Then we had to re enter the digital queue and wait an additional hour.

2nd. We finally show up an hour later than we originally should have been seated. The hostess ignored us. She went inside, sat other people, and then did not come back out. This was 45 minutes prior to closing. Finally 10 minutes later one of the runners asked if he could seat us. Keep in mind when they text you the table is ready after 2 hours, you are supposed to be there in 10 minutes. They don't take reservations and you're not supposed to wait in the street. They suggest you go have a drink around the corner.

3rd. My girlfriend has some severe allergies so I just confirmed with the waiter that there were no nuts or sesame in her dish and he said he'd check with the chef. He forgot to come back.

4. A couple that came 10 minutes after us received their food and drinks. After waiting 20 more minutes and not having even received our drinks, we asked what was going on. They realized that they had forgotten about us completely. The cooks refused to reopen the kitchen and it's now 2300 on a Sunday night in France. Guess what? Not a lot of places still serving food.

5. After being offered drinks and dessert (which I appreciate that the waiter was trying to fix things but dude I gotta eat dinner. It's 11pm) and offering us a meal the next day (we have a noon flight so we aren't around) my girlfriend asked if we could just have a gift card in case we were ever back in Paris and they said no because they ""don't do them"".

I am also writing this as an Asian who has had their fair share of ramen throughout their life (both within europe and mainly asia): it is not worth the hype. Might just be the worst ramen I’ve ever had and I don’t think it’s deserving of the michelin star.

To start off, we waited over 2.5 hours to get in, we had to wait 30 minutes more even when we got the notification from the app that our table was “ready”. The restaurant really doesn’t favor groups of 4 or more.

We ordered edamame, black sesame ramen and shio chicken ramen. The edamame was just sad, overcooked and under-seasoned. The broths were all weirdly flavored and not strong enough, and the noodles were overcooked. The pork charsiu was fine but could’ve done with longer marinating, but the chicken was so heavily seasoned with pepper it overpowered the entire bowl of noodles. What made it worse for us was the fact that they had used salad greens as a garnish instead of spring onions (which was only available for certain ramen) and that you had to pay extra for soft-boiled eggs (which is normal in some restaurants, but most come with at least half an egg off the bat)

Overall, It was a mediocre meal at best but because of how long we waited we practically scoffed our bowls down. It might be an amazing meal to those who rarely eat ramen but to us, who have tasted more ramen than we can keep track off: there are definitely better options out there. Literally visit any ramen restaurant in Asia (doesn’t even have to be Japan) and you’d be blown away.

Secondly, the space isn’t clean, and be careful for broken ramen bowls and broken porcelain spoons. The worst is the queue front of the restaurant and the way the staff  managed it. We’re waiting for more than 1.30 hours and we’re people that passing us and had registered after us.

Atmosphere was great; interior is made to look like Tokyo streets and they even had urban Tokyo soundscapes playing in the background. We ordered a tori-don starter, a Chef’s Paitan and a Chef’s Kurogoma. We were warned about the amount of salt but I think most Europeans think salt and MSG are the same thing. Yes MSG gives that unique taste to most Asian dishes, especially Japanese ramen, but it was TOO MUCH.

The tori don’s chicken AND rice was terribly dry. The sauce had a unique yuzu tangy taste to it but the MSG overpowered it.

Both ramen were novel; a black sesame broth and a rich chicken broth with a mix of yuzu. It was both complex, but felt it was complex just for the sake of being complex. Even then, whatever taste that was supposed to emerge from it eventually got masked with MSG.

I’d give a 1 typically for disappointments, but I’ll give 2 for consolations, like the never-ending patience of the door girl serving everyone, and like how they got the texture of the egg, the noodles and the chashu perfect. But broth is everything in ramen, my friends.

I have visited and lived in Japan for the last 20 years. Anyone who says “authentic” doesn’t have any clue what Japanese ramen is. Japanese do not make their broth like that and do not use “bamboo shoots” in their ramen.  Japanese use “Negi” in their ramen but this restaurant doesn’t use any. No Japanese use “soba” (buckwheat) noodles in their ramen. Ramen is considered as a “junk-food” so buckwheat noodles (healthy) aren't utilized.  They are used in some udon but never in ramen.  The broth has some trace of Chinese peppercorn spice, cilantro and those ingredients are NEVER used in Japanese ramen.  Kodawari uses chicken broth and it is never used in Japanese ramen.
I think people are fooled because of the atmosphere and thousands of reviews by most non-Japanese or Asian people.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUM0bGZLcXZ3RRAB;"Short version: largely overrated, tasteless and yet senselesly salty, light years away from being the best in France or in Europe as some earlier reviews suggested. Do not waste your time queuing for it. It's a trap for tourists and people who don't know much about ramen cuisine.

Long version: I have been to Japan 5 times in many cities, have lived in Asia for 30+ years and 10+ years in Europe and tried countless ramen restaurants. So I consider myself a good authority in rating ramen restaurants.

I had high expectations for Kodawari, as many earlier reviews acclaimed the restaurant to be the best in France / Europe. If you have time and are a real ramen fan, I suggest you take a trip to Toulouse, it's much more worth it.

My impression about Kodawari:
1. The noodles: they were undercooked and therefore failed to absorb the taste of the broth, making the noodles taste like cardboard paper. The noodle type they use (細っ麺) usually (when cooked right) goes well with chicken broth, and yet it was ruined in amateur's hands.

2. The broth: I ordered two different flavors just to do a fair review to the restaurant, one was shoyu ramen with chicken broth and the other was Kaga miso ramen. Both bowls failed to deliver the height of the original recipes, they had no depth nor layers in taste. The shoyu ramen had a faint hint of chicken taste (almost like the broth had been diluted) and the shoyu taste was almost nonexistent (also, it was like if the broth had been diluted very much and just got MSG to raise the umami taste). I barely finished the shoyu ramen, and I couldn't even take half of the Kaga miso ramen soup, it was simply numbingly salty, like a cheap bowl of instant noodles. It was as if the Kaga miso was mixed with some 2nd-grade cheap miso: it didn't taste like anything of what I know about Kaga miso. Two other customers next to me also ordered the Kaga miso ramen and they also said the same: too salty. To give you an idea how salty it is: it's even saltier than Naritake (another well known Ramen restaurant in Paris).

3. The toppings: the pork chashu had no taste and was just stiff and dry, I assume that the meat was overcooked without time to be properly marinated or seasoned and braised over simmering heat (which is the standard Japanese chashu preparation method). In the Kaga miso ramen, they put a slice of eggplant, which I can't understand why, as it was also tasteless and pasty, the texture like a kitchen towel soaked with tooth paste. Toppings in a bowl of ramen are meant to accompany each slurp of noodles by complementing the taste depth and texture.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURmLXRxVGNREAE;"Ce restaurant japonais semble plus conçu comme un décor de cinéma qu’un véritable lieu de gastronomie. Tout est orchestré pour donner l’illusion d’un comptoir de street food dans une ruelle japonaise : éclairage tamisé, murs vieillissants en trompe-l’œil, bruits de rue diffusés par des haut-parleurs… Mais l’expérience tourne rapidement à la déception.

Le processus d’attente, imposé par une application qui demande vos données personnelles, est interminable (quasiment 3h !). L’affichage censé indiquer le nombre de personnes avant vous est aussi peu fiable que frustrant, oscillant sans logique apparente. En réalité, on reste debout à patienter des dizaines de minutes tout en voyant d’autres clients entrer avant vous. Cette gestion chaotique du flux finit par agacer.

Une fois à table, le tableau s’effrite davantage. Les plats sont bons, sans être mémorables, et chaque petit extra – œuf, viande ou sauce – vient alourdir l’addition. Comptez facilement près de 20 € pour un bol correct mais loin d’être généreux. Si le bouillon est savoureux, il ne suffit pas à compenser des portions limitées qui ne calent pas sur la durée.

Quant à l’atmosphère, elle sonne creux. Aucun employé n’est japonais, mais on leur demande de crier régulièrement des phrases en pseudo-japonais, probablement pour renforcer le ""folklore"". Malheureusement, cela ressemble davantage à une mise en scène artificielle qu’à une immersion authentique. L’ensemble donne l’impression d’un piège à touristes qui mise davantage sur le décor et l’ambiance que sur la qualité ou la sincérité de l’expérience.

Ce lieu, vanté par beaucoup, a été pour moi une déception. Entre l’attente interminable, l’authenticité douteuse et un rapport qualité-prix discutable, je ne compte pas y retourner. C’est un exemple parfait de ces adresses qui privilégient l’apparence au détriment du contenu.

N'allez pas chez Kodawari Ramen...

C'est tellement dommage que, sous prétexte d'idolâtrer et de chérir cette culture, vous la marketée !
Vous ne vous souciez pas de la saveur de vos plats, vous ne vous souciez pas non plus de votre clientèle, vous ne vous souciez pas de l'image du Japon que vous dégradez petit à petit.

Vos ramen ne sont pas japonais, votre viande n'est pas fraîche puisqu'elle est surgelée (et vous ne vous en cachez pas).
C'est pourtant dommage, vous qui vantez la qualité de vos produits. Vous vantez la qualité d'un produit qui doit décongeler pendant de longues minutes devant l'intégralité des clients du comptoir...

Le bouillon du ramen Kurogoma (leur spécialité) est IN-BU-VABLE. Étant un fervent amateur de ramen sauce sésame noir et ail, je n'ai rien mangé.
Les tamago (œufs) sont farineux et immondes. Il ne suffit pas d'acheter, de décongeler et de tout mélanger pour que vos ramen soient bons.

Vos cuisiniers et salariés n'ont malheureusement pas l'air passionné par le Japon, ils sont le fruit d'un restaurant qui marche bien.

Le restaurant est petit, étroit, le comptoir est minuscule et trop long. Vous avez fait un restaurant à l'ambiance Yokocho mais il est trop petit. Les clients et serveurs passent leur temps à vous toucher lors de leur passage derrière vous.

Près d'un quart d'heure pour un verre d'umeshu mais trois petites minutes pour deux ramen... C'est suspect.
En même temps, au vu du prix de deux ramen contenants des nouilles et de l'eau salée et/ou amère, on comprend qu'ils s'empressent de vous servir.

Un serveur lent, inefficace et insolent comme j'en ai rarement vu...
La première fois que le serveur nous a apporté notre boisson : c'était la mauvaise.
Ma compagne a demandé plusieurs fois son verre d'umeshu au même serveur. J'arrête sans aucune once de méchanceté ce même garçon qui, en me répondant, ne trouve rien de plus amusant à faire que de me corriger sur ma manière de prononcer le mot ""umeshu""...

Les clients à côté de nous au comptoir ont été installé sur une table non-débarrassée, pas nettoyée et par conséquent pas redressée. Vous gérez mal l'installation de votre clientèle.

Nous sommes venus souriants, contents des tester un nouveau plat de ramen. Nous sommes reparti déçus, très peu satisfaits voire mécontents.

En résumé, une attente longue, une carte chère, des plats absolument pas à la hauteur de votre réputation. Une base de ramen d'amateur, beaucoup de charabia pour des produits de qualité (que l'on retrouve dans d'autres restaurants japonais de ramen). Je ne conseille absolument pas ce restaurant qui cible son chiffre d'affaires plutôt sur que la perfection d'un ramen bien fait.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNmb2RPLTVnRRAB;"Allergiques aux arachides, passez votre chemin.

Je suis actuellement en voyage en France, et pour l’occasion, j’avais vraiment envie de goûter ce ramen dont j’entends parler si souvent. Avant de m’y rendre, j’ai bien sûr pris le temps de me renseigner pour savoir si mon allergie poserait un problème. Tout semblait indiquer que non.

Une fois sur place, après 45 minutes d’attente, on s’installe avec mon groupe et on commence à regarder le menu. Avant de commander, j’informe la serveuse de mon allergie. Elle part se renseigner, revient avec un papier rouge pour que j’y note mon allergie, puis me demande si elle est mortelle. Je réponds que ""oui"".

Son attitude déjà peu chaleureuse me mettait mal à l’aise, mais sa réponse fut encore pire : ""Nous ne vous servirons pas.""

C’est bien la première fois qu’on me refuse un service aussi directement. Aucune explication : est-ce que le bouillon contient des arachides ? Y a-t-il une alternative ? Absolument rien.
On m’a simplement proposé de commander une boisson.

Finalement, je décide de partir. Avant de quitter, on demande à d’autres serveurs, qui avaient l’air un peu plus aimables, pourquoi on m’a refusé. On m’explique alors qu’il y a déjà eu un incident dans le passé, ce qui les rend réticents à servir des clients avec une telle allergie.

Je peux comprendre que ce genre d’incident ait pu être marquant et qu’ils veuillent éviter d’en revivre un autre. Mais honnêtement, une meilleure façon de gérer la situation aurait fait toute la différence. Là, j’ai juste eu l’impression d’être un ""problème"" ou une cliente ""différente"". La manière dont ça a été dit m’a vraiment fait me sentir mal.

Je pense qu’il serait essentiel d’indiquer clairement sur votre site ou votre menu les risques liés aux allergènes. Surtout que rien n’était mentionné concernant la présence d’arachides dans vos plats, à part une note demandant d’avertir le serveur. En Europe, selon le règlement n°1169/2011, les allergènes doivent être clairement identifiés.

Pour un restaurant aussi bien noté et apprécié, je trouve ça assez choquant. La gestion des allergènes devrait être irréprochable : séparer les aliments, nettoyer les ustensiles, former le personnel à mieux gérer ce genre de situation. On ne peut pas tout éviter, mais un minimum est attendu, surtout pour des allergies graves.

Bref, je suis vraiment déçue de cet accueil et de cette expérience.  Déjà qu’annoncer une allergie à un serveur n’est jamais facile, être traité de la sorte rendra mes futures sorties au restaurant encore plus angoissantes.

Tout d'abord il y a une assez longue queue mais ce n'est pas si embêtant que cela si seulement nous avions eu une bonne expérience.

En effet, parlons du plus important : la nourriture. Ce restaurant de ramen très connu pour être ""authentique"" n'a pas su me satisfaire malgré mon amour pour les nouilles asiatiques en général. Ce n'est, contrairement, aux autres avis pas si incroyable que cela, c'est bon mais sans plus.

De plus, les serveurs sont très pressés ce que je peux comprendre, mais on nous a ""ignorer"" quand on a voulu passer notre commande.
Ensuite, l'attente des nouilles étaient particulièrement longue contrairement aux clients assis a coté de nous.

Une fois servie, je déguste le ramen. Je trouve un cheveux dans les nouilles donc non pas dans la soupe mais bien les nouilles en elles même. Je fais donc la remarque non pas aux serveuses mais bien à mon amie présente avec moi. La serveuse me dit donc que ce ne sont pas eux mais ma faute à moi. Alors, oui, je peux accepter le fait que par une raison quelconque après être passé au toilette, je m'assois et je trouve un cheveux dans les nouilles, soit. Peut être est-ce un cheveux qui à volé. Ce n'est pas un problème pour moi et je ne veux pas faire de scène dans le restaurant.
Outre ce fait, ce qui m'a particulièrement dérangé c'est l'attitude de la serveuse une fois mon commentaire émis auprès de mon amie. En effet, me dire ""nous on porte des charlottes mais pas vous à ce que je sache"" je trouve cela particulièrement désagréable de sa part et mal venu alors que je ne l'a parlais même pas.

2 ans plus tard, le constat est sans appel ni surprise : c'était mieux avant.
Cette phrase de vieux con est ici amplement justifiée : le système de queue virtuelle est honteux (2h d'attente, soit 30 min de plus que prévu par le site), le service au mieux blasé et au pire excédé (ce que je comprends : bosser dans ce genre de conditions faut pas envie), et la cuisine..... Bah c'est moins copieux, plus cher et moins bon. J'ai comparé la photo d'il y a deux ans, et va se voit clairement a l'oeil nu (la couleur, opacité et accroche du bouillon sur le (petit) bol.

Impeccable, la longue attente valait le coup au final ~ depuis le Japon, rarement mangé des ramens aussi bonnes : bouillon parfumé et pâtes piles dans la norme. L’interieur fait penser a d’obscures ruelles de Setagaya : assez bluffant de réalisme ~ tout le staff fait de son mieux pour coller a l’ambiance a grand renforts d’’irrasshiaimase, : de quoi faire oublier la mauvaise humeur de la personne responsable de l’accueil (le travail est pas forcément agréable mais c’est pas la peine d’être aussi désagréable x)).

Pour 13€ vous avez le droit à 30g de porc haché, autant faire du végétarien à ce compte là.

While tipping may not be customary in Japan, this claim generalizes cultural practices and imposes them on a restaurant operating in France, where tipping is more common.

Criticizing this adaptation reflects cultural bias rather than evaluating the restaurant fairly based on its location.

The assertion that ""le patron force les clients à envisager de laisser un pourboire"" due to the payment terminal displaying tipping options is subjective. The system allows users to opt out of tipping, which does not constitute coercion or force.

J’arrive à ma place, il y avait plus mon ramen et surtout il y avait des gens qui avait été installé. J’avais pourtant demandé où était les toilettes donc ils savaient que j’étais aux toilettes.

Honnêtement j’étais à deux doigts de partir sans payer (j’aurai pu) mais comme je suis pas méchante de base j’ai attendu sagement qu’on vienne m’encaisser. J’ai bien payé 14,5€ mais j’aurai préféré avoir les excuses offertes en supplément.

Une serveuse très peu aimable (c'est le moins de le dire) m'a parlé comme à un vulgaire chien, et m'a indiqué que pour prendre en photo le QR code DEVANT MOI, je devais attendre que tout le monde scanne le qr code avant moi  (???).  Il y avait 15-30 mn d'attente à vue de nez, sans doute plus. Attendre 15/30 minutes pour avoir la joie que le QR code te dise que tu as 2h d'attente... non mais dans quel délire vous êtes ?

C'était déjà ingérable avant l'introduction des QR code, c'est devenu pire avec ce nouvel ajout. A un moment il va falloir choisir, entre la réservation classique ou le service continue, mais ce système est inadmissible, surtout quand vos ""serveurs"" et autres accueillants sont de ce niveau de politesse.

Tout d'abord je ne m'attarderai pas sur la longue attente, qui n'est pas de la faute de l'établissement qui est simplement victime de son succès. La gestion de la queue est d'ailleurs  bien maîtrisée : on s'inscrit sur une liste sur place et on est appelé quand son tour arrive.

L'ambiance dans le restaurant est sympa mais on est rapidement mal à l'aise avec le fond sonore qui est tout simplement trop présent, archi répétitif et qui n'est pas du tout naturel avec une ""musique"" qui imite les bruits environnants d'une ville japonaise. Et cela en boucle.
Franchement, on se sentait plus dans un parking en sous-sol que dans un quartier japonais.

Ensuite, j'ai clairement été déçu par le ramen en lui même. Je suis pourtant bon public et ai tout fait pour être de bonne foi mais je suis désolé : le bouillon est fade, les nouilles sont d'une banalité et le prix est assez élevé pour ce que c'est. Les salades en entrée ou accompagnements sont très chères pour des quantités qui sont ridicules.

( L'huile piquante existe mais c'est aux clients de s'en servir s'ils en ont envie). L'oeuf était juste très salé. Je sentais mon estomac lourd jusqu'au lendemain. Au Japon un ramen c'est un plat populaire et rapide donc pas cher (5-7euro) et on peut commander une autre portion de nouille pour 1-2 euro (que Kodawari ne propose pas bien évidemment alors qu'un bol de ramen coûte 18 euro ici). Le riz n'est pas en entrée mais plutôt après le ramen pour manger avec la soupe. Je pense qu'il est normal de ne pas être authentique à 100% pour un plat japonais en France mais là c'est trop éloigné alors que l'authenticité semble d'être leur argument de vente. ..;Authentique ;2;2 years ago;2022-12-31T06:59:48Z;0;115195567910878528825;Sayaka MASUOKA;49;5;VRAI;;;2;2;3
ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURodUxyUWZBEAE;"+ ramens de bonne qualité,  entrée sympatique quoique portion un peu trop petite au vu du prix pour certaines

- service déplorable : apéritif, entrée et  plat servis simultanément, installés au pass, quand nous demandons au serveur de pouvoir terminer au moins notre apéritif et notre entrée avant que le plat ne soit servis , refus de sa part ( ""on a pas le temps on a trop de monde j 'en fais quoi de l'assiette je la  jette? les cuisiniers ont l'habitude de tout envoyer en même temps, il faut préciser à la commande  qu'on ne veut pas tout simultanément, je n'ai jamais vu qu'on ne recevait pas l'intégralité des commandes en une seule fois y compris dans un autre restaurant"")  etc bref  une multitude d'excuses plus un comportement très désagréable ensuite du serveur en question, à la limite de la moquerie ( remarque du type ""alors pas trop froids vos ramens ?"" le sourire aux lèvres)

Le directeur s'est malgré tout excusé et nous à offert les apéritifs geste apprécié.   .

Conclusion, au même titre que la cuisine, le service c'est un métier, un métier qui s'apprend et de préférence avec un minimum d'attrait pour le contact client.

Quand on ne peut assurer une qualité minimum pour 600 couverts par service, on en fait moins.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURVblBpYm13RRAB;"Bonjour
Je ne m'étendrais pas trop sur la qualité de la soupe que j'ai mangé à midi.
Certes j'ai été déçu, (très salé, et au final un seul goût prédominant : celui du bouillon, et non pas une multitude comme ce à quoi je m'attendais.) Mais je suis incapable de dissocier totalement mon assiette (mon bol) de mon expérience globale.
Aucun problème avec l'attente, je m'y attendais (arrivé 15, min avant l'ouverture, j'ai ensuite été servi rapidement). Aucun problème aussi avec l'accueil. Les jeunes, on le sens, se donnent à fond.
Ce qui m'a vraiment refroidi (hormis comme je l'ai dit la relative déception du plat) est que assis, au bar, j'ai assisté au boulot de malade qu'opère le chef soupier. Il a les poignets brûlés au second degré (sans vouloir me mêler de ce qui ne me regarde pas), il touille les nouilles très très rapidement pour les cuire, mais aussi très très souvent, et à chaque fois, de l'eau bouillante lui gicle sur les poignets. Alors certes, il n'a rien dit, et malgré la brûlure sur les poignets, facile au second degré (écorchure rouge de 5 à 10cm) et peut être n'en souffre pas. Mais je n'aime pas bien la douleur, et en quelque sorte, j'ai souffert pour lui.
Sérieux, quelque chose déconne, et ce n'est pas compliqué de trouver quoi.
Il y a trop de monde! Trop de succès. (Et franchement, objectivement, ce n'était pas non plus l'extase sensorielle - mais comment cela aurait-il pû l'être, avec un régime de production quasi-industriel, voir quasi fast-food?) Alors certes le bouillon, lui,  mijote tranquille à l'avance (peut être pendant toute la matinée), et ce que j'ai aperçu quand ils ont levé ces immenses couvercles avait une belle allure.
Si il y avait, 10 fois moins de clients, personne n'aurait besoin de se brûler, d'être aussi tendu et sérieux derrière ses fourneaux (le job aussi, de griller aux chalumeaux des dizaines de rangées de filets et de travers etc... non-stop) du travail à la chaine. Alors non, je ne me réjouis pas de manger dans un lieu où on est forcé de travailler ainsi.
Si les gars et les demoiselles sont payés au moins 25OO euros, soit, cela peut être valable, soyons pragmatiques (quoique des baguettes un peu plus longues éviteraient peut être une part des brûlures).
Mais si ils subissent ce type de pression juste pour garder leur job. Alors là, on est en plein système de rentabilité. Et le Itadakimass, et l'amabilité du personnel, qui encore une fois se donne à fond, malheureusement ne contrebalancent pas ce bazar.";PARTIEL (0.99): 1.

Venant chez Kodawari depuis plus d’un an et demi, j’etais au début sous le charme tant par l’ambiance que la nourriture proposée.
Cependant, même si la qualité des ramens proposés est toujours au rendez-vous, le service client est lui sur une mauvaise voie.
En effet, client régulier et conquit, j’ai expérimenté quelques déconvenues.

Première en date, ayant été placé sur une place vraiment étroite (je ne pouvais pas être assis face à la table), le serveur m’a refusé un changement de place pour le comptoir « car réservé à des gens qui attendaient spécifiquement ». Tout à fait compréhensible, sauf quand les gens placés au comptoir ne se connaissent pas et n’ont nullement demandé à y être.

Deuxième déconvenue. Celle au moment du paiement. En effet, ayant un budget serré (et Kodawari c’est l’assurance de bien manger pour un prix honnête) l’addition était plus élevée qu’a l’habitude pour une commande que j’ai l’habitude de prendre.
En discutant à la caisse, on m’annonce que j’ai pris un supplément, or je n’ai jamais demandé quoique ce soit. Cependant la serveuse insiste sur le fait que nous avions mangé les ramens avec le supplément et que nous devions donc payer le supplément, même s’il nous a été donc imposé.
La serveuse qui c’est occupé de nous, passant plusieurs fois voir ce qui se passait n’a jamais pris la peine d’avouer son erreur ou d’essayer de comprendre. Il a fallu pas moins de 10 petites minutes pour qu’enfin on nous donne raison.

En résumé, un endroit avec une décoration et une ambiance très bien réalisées, une nourriture aussi de qualité mais qui commence à pencher du côté « usine ». En clair, en raison de leur succès, ils ne se préoccupent pas de savoir si des clients reviendront ou non.

Les pickles ? le gingembre ? ou même la hot sauce ?)... 1 bol de riz au porc, 1 ramen au shoyu : fades ! Mais vraiment fades !!

Des choses simples qui font la différence, comme juste par exemple, les oshiboris pour se rincer les doigts (chaudes ou froides, tout dépend de quel temps il fait) aurait apporté une dimension japonisante et un service supplémentaire. Des ""irashaimase"" et des ""arigatou gozaimasu"", dits par un quart du staff (alors qu'au Japon c'est jusqu'au plongeur que l'on ""hurle"" ça lorsqu'un client entre et sort du restaurant), ici en plus, avec des accents français, voire américains : Non.
